# Computer-aided analysis of West Sub-Saharan Africa snakes venome towards the design of epitope-based poly-specific antivenoms

This project involves the prediction of epitopes of snake venom toxins with the objective to select and use them as an alternative immunogen for the synthesis of antivenoms.

The pipeline followed generates predictions for Category 1 and Category 1+2 snakes of West Sub-Saharan Africa, at different clusterization thresholds (95% to 50%).

For this publication, we used the Category 1+2 snakes approach with a 70% threshold.
